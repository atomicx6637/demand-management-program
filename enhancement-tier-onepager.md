## Decision Criteria

Your Enhancement will be approved if it meets these criteria:

✅ **Value Articulated:** Demonstrates positive value in at least ONE category:
- Operational (efficiency, safety, reliability)
- Financial (cost savings, cost avoidance)
- Customer (experience, satisfaction)
- Regulatory/Compliance (meets requirements, reduces risk)
- Strategic/Capability (enables future capabilities)

✅ **Budget Available:** Funding exists in product team's budget

✅ **Scope Clear:** Request is clear and understandable

✅ **Tier Appropriate:** Truly <$50k and low/medium complexity

✅ **Architectural Fit:** Aligns with architectural standards (if DAR review required)

---

## When Does DAR Review Get Triggered?

Your Enhancement may require Domain Architecture Reviewer (DAR) review if it involves:
- Integration with other systems (even simple ones)
- Customer data or PII
- Cloud services or external APIs
- Security considerations
- Deviation from known architectural patterns

**Don't worry - your Product Team Lead will identify this and route appropriately.**

## Common Reasons for Rejection

❌ **This is actually break-fix/incident** → Route to Incident Management instead
❌ **Duplicate request** → Already submitted or in progress
❌ **No clear value** → Articulate the business value or benefit
❌ **Cost exceeds $50k** → Should be submitted as Tier 3 Project
❌ **Too complex** → High complexity should be Tier 2 or Tier 3

---

## After Approval - What to Expect

1. **Added to Product Team Backlog** - Your Enhancement joins the prioritized work queue
2. **Sprint Planning** - Product Team Lead schedules based on capacity and priority
3. **Development** - Your Enhancement is built and tested
4. **Deployment** - Solution is deployed to production
5. **Value Tracking** - Sample-based tracking (10-15% of Enhancements quarterly)

**Typical Timeline from Approval to Delivery:** 2-12 weeks depending on team capacity and priority

## Tips for a Great Enhancement Request

💡 **Be Specific:** "Add customer name column to dashboard" is better than "improve dashboard"

💡 **Quantify Value:** "Save 10 hours/month" is better than "save time"

💡 **Attach Mockups:** Visual examples help clarify your request

💡 **Identify Beneficiaries:** Who benefits? How many people? How often?

💡 **Right-Size Your Request:** If it's bigger than it seems, talk to your Product Team Lead first
