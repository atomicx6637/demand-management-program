## What Qualifies as Tier 2?

✅ **Your project should be submitted as Tier 2 if it meets:**

**Cost + Complexity Matrix:**
- **>$2M + Low Complexity**, OR
- **$500k-$2M + Medium Complexity**, OR
- **$50k-$500k + High Complexity**

**Project Characteristics:**
- Significant project with enterprise impact
- Cross-domain integration and process changes
- Substantial architectural implications
- Value realization over 2-3 years
- Requires executive sponsorship

**Examples:**
- Customer portal modernization
- Operational technology system upgrade
- Enterprise data integration initiative
- Workforce management system implementation
- High-complexity middleware replacement (even if <$500k)

---

## Prioritization Category

Tier 2 projects are typically categorized as **Priority Development** or **Improvement**.

-   **Priority Development:** Initiatives that create new capabilities or differentiate the business.
-   **Improvement:** Initiatives that improve operational or capital efficiency.

---

## Complexity Assessment - Critical for Tier 2

**Medium Complexity:**
- Multiple systems (2-4 integrations)
- Cross-functional business processes
- Mix of proven and newer technologies
- Multiple departments impacted
- Moderate process redesign

**High Complexity:**
- Enterprise-wide systems (5+ integrations)
- Significant new technology introduction
- Transformational change across organization
- Platform replacement or new capability
- Major architectural shift

**If >$2M + High Complexity** → May be Tier 1 (transformational program)

## How to Submit - **Strategic Interview-Based Process**

### **Step 1: Submit High-Level Intake (5-10 minutes)**

Go to ServiceNow → **Submit Demand Request** → Select **"Tier 2 Project"**

**Simple 1-page form includes:**
- Project title and executive sponsor information
- Strategic objective alignment (which enterprise goals?)
- Estimated cost and complexity (Medium/High)
- High-level business need and strategic importance
- Who will benefit across organization?
- High-level solution overview
- Systems/platforms involved
- Expected value categories

- Desired timeline

**No lengthy business case required at intake.**

---

### **Step 2: Pre-Screening by EA + Strategic Planning**

**Within 2-3 business days**, EA and Strategic Planning Office will:
- Review strategic alignment
- Validate executive sponsorship
- Assess timing and feasibility
- Decide: Proceed / Table / Reject

**If approved to proceed**, EA schedules **60-minute strategic interview**.

---

### **Step 3: Strategic Interview (60 minutes)**

**Comprehensive interview facilitated by Senior EA + Strategic Planning**

**Participants:**
- You (Business Sponsor)
- Executive Sponsor
- Key SMEs
- EA Senior Architect
- Strategic Planning representative
- Finance (optional)
- EPMO (optional)

**Interview Agenda (60 minutes):**
1. **Strategic Context** (15 min) - How this enables strategy, timing, urgency, competitive drivers
2. **Business Need** (10 min) - Detailed problem, current state pain, impact of not proceeding
3. **Solution & Architecture** (15 min) - Proposed solution, alternatives, systems involved, architectural implications
4. **Value & Benefits** (10 min) - Value across all 5 categories, measurement, financial impact
5. **Organizational Impact** (5 min) - Departments affected, process changes, change management
6. **Risks & Resources** (5 min) - Key risks, resource requirements, timeline, dependencies

**Interview is recorded** (Teams/Zoom with transcription) for comprehensive documentation.

---

### **Step 4: EA Develops Formal Business Case**

**EA leads collaborative business case development:**

**EA Team:**
- Drafts 15-20 page Tier 2 Business Case
- Performs architecture review and assessment
- Coordinates all components

**Finance:**
- Builds financial model (NPV, IRR, payback, sensitivity analysis)

**EPMO (if requested):**
- Develops detailed project plan and resource estimates

**Strategic Planning:**
- Validates strategic fit and alignment

**Your Role:**
- Review draft business case (30-minute review meeting)
- Validate assumptions and provide feedback
- Approve final business case for governance

**Timeline:** 7-10 days for full business case development

---

### **Step 5: Governance - Multi-Stage Review**

**Architecture Board** (EA team formal review) → Approve architecture

**Technology Subcommittee** (bi-weekly) → Deep dive presentation, recommend to TAC

**TAC** (monthly) → Funding decision

**You'll present at Tech Sub and TAC** (15-20 minutes each with Q&A)

---

## Timeline: 14-16 Business Days from Submission to Governance-Ready

| Phase | Duration | Your Involvement |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Pre-Screening | 2-3 days | None - EA/Strategy handles |
| Interview Scheduling | 2-4 days | Confirm availability |
| Strategic Interview | 60 min | Active participation with exec sponsor |
| Business Case Development | 7-10 days | Review draft (30 min meeting) |
| Quality Review & Routing | 1-2 days | Approve final |
| **Total** | **14-16 days** | **~3-4 hours total** |

**Then add:** Architecture Board + Tech Sub (bi-weekly) + TAC (monthly) cycles

**Typical Calendar Time:** 6-10 weeks from submission to funding decision

---

## Decision Criteria - Rigorous Value Standards

### **Value Threshold:**
✅ Must demonstrate **substantial value across MULTIPLE categories (minimum 3)**:
1. **Operational Value** - Detailed quantification with supporting data
2. **Financial Value** - Full financial model (NPV, IRR, payback period)
3. **Customer Value** - Measurable customer impact
4. **Regulatory/Compliance Value** - Compliance achievement, risk reduction
5. **Strategic/Capability Value** - Strategic alignment clearly articulated

✅ Benefits exceed costs; positive NPV over 5-year horizon
✅ Sensitivity analysis showing value under different scenarios
✅ Detailed benefit realization plan with named benefit owners

### **Other Critical Criteria:**
✅ **Executive Sponsor Committed** - Identified and actively engaged
✅ **Strategic Alignment** - Clearly supports enterprise strategic objectives
✅ **Architecturally Sound** - Mandatory Architecture Board approval
✅ **Resources Feasible** - Resources potentially available (people, budget, vendors)
✅ **Change Management Planned** - Organizational impact assessed

---

## Common Reasons for Re-Tiering or Rejection

🔄 **Re-tiered to Tier 3:** Complexity lower than assessed (e.g., only 2 system integrations, proven technology)
🔄 **Re-tiered to Tier 1:** Complexity higher + strategic significance warrants program-level governance
❌ **Rejected:** Insufficient value across 3+ categories
❌ **Rejected:** No executive sponsor or sponsor not appropriate level
❌ **Rejected:** Architecturally infeasible or major conflicts with standards
❌ **Tabled:** Strategic alignment weak or timing not right

---

## After Approval - Transition to Program Execution

Once TAC approves your project:

1. **EA Transitions to EPMO** - Formal handoff from demand to delivery
2. **Project Manager Assigned Early** - Senior PM assigned during qualification
3. **Detailed Project Charter** - Comprehensive planning with EPMO
4. **Architecture Governance** - Ongoing EA involvement during execution
5. **Semi-Annual Value Reviews** - Presented to Tech Subcommittee every 6 months
6. **Benefit Realization Tracking** - Quarterly tracking with named benefit owners

---

## What Makes a Great Tier 2 Submission?

### **DO:**
✅ **Secure executive sponsor BEFORE submitting** - Must be VP-level or above
✅ **Align to strategic objectives** - Clear connection to enterprise strategy
✅ **Quantify value across multiple categories** - Think beyond just financial ROI
✅ **Be honest about complexity** - High complexity is okay if value justifies it
✅ **Identify organizational impacts** - Change management is critical at this scale
✅ **Bring SMEs to interview** - Technical, business, and operational experts
✅ **Prepare for deep-dive presentations** - You'll present to Tech Sub and TAC

### **DON'T:**
❌ **Submit without executive sponsor** - You'll be rejected
❌ **Understate complexity** - Causes re-tiering and delays; EA will catch it
❌ **Only articulate financial value** - Tier 2 requires value across 3+ categories
❌ **Skip strategic alignment** - "This would be nice" doesn't meet Tier 2 bar
❌ **Ignore organizational change** - Process and people changes are as important as technology
