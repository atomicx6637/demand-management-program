## Executive Summary

This guide integrates Quantum Energy's annual capital funding cycle into the Business Unit Engagement Model. The capital cycle runs July → October, with specific milestones for capital investment submissions, reviews, and final funding recommendations. This creates a **critical engagement period** where EA must work intensively with business units to shape capital-funded demands before submission.

**Capital Funding Cycle Overview:**
- **July:** Capital funding submissions begin
- **August:** Initial reviews and feedback
- **Late October:** Final funding recommendations and approvals

**Key Implications for Engagement Model:**
1. **Annual Strategic Engagement timing** should align with capital planning (May-June preparation)
2. **Capital Planning Sprint** (June-July) for intensive demand shaping
3. **Differentiated approach** for CapEx vs. OpEx demands
4. **Pipeline visibility** critical 6-9 months before capital submission

---

## 1. Capital Funding Cycle & Demand Types

### 1.1 Understanding Capital vs. Operating Funded Demands

**Capital-Funded Demands:**
- Require capital budget allocation
- Subject to annual capital planning cycle (July-October)
- Typically include: new systems, major upgrades, infrastructure, transformational programs
- Must be submitted and approved during capital planning window
- Planning horizon: 12-18 months before project execution
- Tiers affected: Primarily Tier 3, Tier 2, Tier 1 (some large Enhancements)

**Operating-Funded Demands:**
- Funded from operating budget (OpEx)
- NOT subject to annual capital cycle; can be submitted anytime
- Typically include: small enhancements, support/maintenance, SaaS subscriptions, consulting
- Faster approval cycle (not waiting for annual capital process)
- Tiers affected: Primarily Enhancement tier, some Tier 3

**Hybrid-Funded Demands:**
- Require both CapEx and OpEx funding
- Must participate in capital planning for CapEx portion
- OpEx portion may need separate approval

### 1.2 Capital Planning Cycle Timeline

```
ANNUAL CAPITAL FUNDING CYCLE

January - April: Strategic Planning & Portfolio Planning
├─ Enterprise strategic planning
├─ Budget forecasting and guidance
└─ Initial capital envelope discussions

May - June: Demand Shaping & Preparation (EA ENGAGEMENT INTENSIVE PERIOD)
├─ Business units identify capital investment needs
├─ EA engages proactively to shape demands
├─ Business cases developed collaboratively
└─ Architecture assessments conducted

July: Capital Submission Window Opens
├─ Business units submit capital-funded demands
├─ EA screens and validates submissions
└─ Initial prioritization and portfolio review

August: Initial Reviews & Feedback
├─ Finance reviews financial justifications
├─ EA/PMO reviews technical feasibility and portfolio fit
├─ Feedback provided to business units
└─ Business units refine submissions

September - Early October: Portfolio Rationalization
├─ Enterprise portfolio review and prioritization
├─ Trade-off discussions and portfolio balancing
├─ Executive review (Technology Subcommittee, TAC)
└─ Preliminary funding recommendations

Late October: Final Funding Decisions
├─ Final executive review and approval
├─ Capital funding allocations confirmed
├─ Approved demands move to execution planning
└─ Deferred demands communicated with feedback

November - December: Execution Planning
├─ Approved demands transition to project execution
├─ Resource planning and vendor procurement
└─ Preparation for January project starts
```

**Critical Insight:** EA must engage with business units **May-June** to shape capital demands before the July submission window. Waiting until July means demands are already formed, reducing EA's ability to influence quality and strategic alignment.

---

## 2. Adjusted Annual Engagement Timing

### 2.1 Recommended Annual Engagement Schedule

**Original Recommendation (from BU Engagement Model):** Q4 (October-November)

**Revised Recommendation for Capital Planning Alignment:**

#### **Annual Strategic Engagement: May-June**

**Rationale:**
- Conducted **before** capital submission window (July)
- Provides 1-2 months for collaborative demand shaping
- Aligns with business unit capital planning preparation
- Positions EA as partner in capital planning, not just reviewer

**Timing:** Late May through June (complete all Annual Engagements by end of June)

**Adjusted Agenda Focus:**
- Strategic priorities for **upcoming fiscal year** (aligned with capital planning)
- Capability gaps requiring **capital investment**
- Capital demand pipeline (demands expected to submit in July)
- Operating demand pipeline (continuous throughout year)
- Prioritization given expected capital envelope constraints

---

#### **Capital Planning Reconciliation: November**

**Purpose:** Reconcile capital planning outcomes with strategic roadmap; adjust for next year

**Timing:** November (after capital funding decisions finalized)

**Agenda (1.5 hours):**
1. **Capital Funding Outcomes (30 min)**
   - Review which capital demands were approved, deferred, or rejected
   - Understand funding constraints and trade-offs made
   - Discuss implications for capability roadmap

2. **Adjusted Capability Roadmap (30 min)**
   - Update capability roadmap based on approved capital funding
   - Identify capability gaps not addressed (deferred demands)
   - Discuss alternative approaches (OpEx-funded, phased, deferred)

3. **Lessons Learned (15 min)**
   - What worked well in capital planning process?
   - What could improve for next cycle?
   - EA and business unit feedback

4. **Look Ahead to Next Capital Cycle (15 min)**
   - Preliminary discussion of next year's capital priorities
   - Strategic initiatives on the horizon
   - Early demand shaping opportunities

**Outcome:**
- Updated capability roadmap reflecting approved capital funding
- Lessons learned for next capital cycle
- Early visibility into next year's capital pipeline

**Note:** This is a **lighter version** of the Annual Strategic Engagement, focused on reconciliation and adjustment rather than full strategic planning.

- Preliminary prioritization recommendations

**Example Portfolio Summary:**
```
ENTERPRISE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO SUMMARY - FY 2027 CAPITAL CYCLE

Total Capital Demands: 28 demands across 8 business units
Total Capital Request: $42.5M
Expected Capital Envelope: ~$30M
Gap: $12.5M (need to prioritize/defer ~30%)

By Tier:
- Tier 1: 3 demands, $18M
- Tier 2: 8 demands, $15.5M
- Tier 3: 17 demands, $9M

By Strategic Objective:
- Customer Experience: $12M (28%)
- Operational Excellence: $10.5M (25%)
- Grid Modernization: $11M (26%)
- Regulatory Compliance: $5M (12%)
- Other: $4M (9%)

Portfolio Balance: Reasonably balanced across strategic priorities

Key Insights:
- Customer Experience over-weighted; may need to defer some demands
- Grid Modernization under-weighted relative to strategic importance
- 5 demands have overlapping scope (customer data capabilities) → Opportunity to consolidate

Recommended Actions:
1. Consolidate customer data capability investments into single Tier 1 program
2. Defer 2 lower-priority Customer Experience Tier 3 demands
3. Prioritize Grid Modernization Tier 2 demand (currently Priority 2 → Priority 1)
```

---

#### **Phase 4: Capital Submission & Initial Review (Weeks 9-10, July)**

**Activities:**
- Business units **formally submit capital demands** (early-mid July)
- EA **screens all capital submissions** rapidly
  - Validate completeness and quality
  - Confirm strategic alignment and architecture feasibility
  - Flag any issues or gaps
  - Provide preliminary approval or feedback
- Finance reviews financial justifications
- PMO validates resource availability and execution feasibility

**EA Deliverable:**
- Screening assessment for each capital demand (Approved to proceed / Feedback needed)
- **Capital Portfolio Dashboard** for governance review (August)

**Typical Issues Caught During Screening:**
- Incomplete business cases (missing sections or inadequate detail)
- Strategic misalignment (demand doesn't clearly support strategic priority)
- Architecture concerns (feasibility, standards compliance, integration complexity)
- Overlapping scope with other demands
- Unrealistic benefit estimates or timelines
- Organizational readiness gaps

**EA Response:**
- Provide rapid feedback to business units (within 3-5 days)
- Offer support to address issues before August reviews
- Escalate significant concerns to EA Leadership and CIO/CTO

---

### 3.3 Capital Planning Sprint Resourcing

**EA Team Capacity During Sprint:**

The Capital Planning Sprint is **the most intensive engagement period** for the EA team. Plan for increased capacity allocation:

**May-June (Demand Shaping & Business Case Development):**
- **Tier 1 BUs:** 40-50% of assigned EA time (up from typical 20-30%)
- **Tier 2 BUs:** 20-30% of assigned EA time (up from typical 10-15%)
- EA team should minimize other commitments during this period
- Consider "all hands on deck" approach for EA team

**July (Capital Submission & Screening):**
- EA team focused on rapid screening and feedback
- 60-70% of EA team capacity dedicated to capital demand review
- Quick turnaround critical (business units need feedback to refine)

**Recommended Approach:**
- Plan EA team capacity allocation in advance (Q1)
- Defer non-critical EA activities to Q3 (post-capital planning)
- Communicate with stakeholders about reduced EA availability for other work during May-July
- Provide additional support to EA team (temporary resources, extended hours, etc.)

## 4. Differentiated Engagement for CapEx vs. OpEx Demands

### 4.1 Capital-Funded Demand Engagement

**Timing:** Aligned with annual capital cycle (May-July submission)

**Engagement Intensity:** High (must be ready for July submission)

**Process:**
1. **Identified during Annual Strategic Engagement** (May-June)
2. **Shaped during Capital Planning Sprint** (May-July)
3. **Submitted in July** capital window
4. **Reviewed August-October** as part of capital planning process
5. **Approved/Deferred in Late October**
6. **Execution planning November-December** (if approved)
7. **Project execution begins** following fiscal year

**EA Focus:**
- Strategic alignment and portfolio fit
- Capability investment thesis
- Architecture feasibility and standards compliance
- Multi-year value realization
- Organizational readiness

**Business Case Requirements:**
- Full business case (Tier 3/2/1 requirements)
- Multi-year financial model (capital + operating costs)
- Benefits realization over 5+ years
- Architecture review completed before submission
- Governance-ready presentation

---

### 4.2 Operating-Funded Demand Engagement

**Timing:** Continuous throughout the year (not tied to capital cycle)

**Engagement Intensity:** Moderate (standard demand management process)

**Process:**
1. **Identified during Quarterly Business Reviews or Monthly Working Sessions**
2. **Submitted anytime** via standard demand intake
3. **Screened and qualified** per normal demand management process (days/weeks, not months)
4. **Approved via standard governance** (Product Lead for Enhancement, Tech Subcommittee for Tier 3/2)
5. **Execution begins** shortly after approval

**EA Focus:**
- Technical feasibility and standards alignment
- Rapid architecture guidance
- Integration with capital-funded initiatives
- Efficient approval process

**Business Case Requirements:**
- Lighter business case (appropriate to tier)
- Operating cost focus (annual OpEx impact)
- Near-term value realization (1-2 years)
- Streamlined architecture review
- Faster governance process

---

### 4.3 Decision Tree: CapEx vs. OpEx

**How to Determine if Demand Needs Capital Funding:**

```
START: New Demand Identified

Does the demand involve any of the following?
- Purchase of new hardware or infrastructure
- Major software license purchases (perpetual licenses)
- Implementation of new systems or platforms
- Significant system upgrades or replacements
- Capital projects (construction, facilities, equipment)
- Total cost >$50k AND useful life >1 year

    YES → Likely requires CAPITAL FUNDING
         ↓
         Must participate in annual capital planning cycle
         Submit during July capital window
         Full business case and architecture review required
         Approval in October; execution next fiscal year

    NO → Likely can be OPERATING FUNDED
         ↓
         Can be submitted anytime via standard demand process
         Faster approval cycle (not waiting for capital planning)
         Streamlined business case appropriate to tier

EDGE CASES (Consult Finance):
- Cloud/SaaS subscriptions (often OpEx but may have CapEx components)
- Software maintenance/support (typically OpEx)
- Consulting services (typically OpEx unless part of capital project)
- Hybrid solutions (part CapEx, part OpEx)

IMPORTANT: Funding classification determined by Finance during screening
Business units should indicate expected funding type during intake
EA provides architecture input; Finance makes final funding determination
```

## 12. Conclusion

Integrating the annual capital funding cycle into the Business Unit Engagement Model ensures that:

✅ **EA engages early** (May-June) to shape capital demands before July submission
✅ **Business units receive intensive support** during Capital Planning Sprint
✅ **Capital demands are high quality** → fewer rejections, faster approvals
✅ **Portfolio is strategically balanced** → EA provides enterprise portfolio perspective
✅ **Capital funding decisions are informed** by architecture and capability insights

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Timing is critical:** Annual Strategic Engagement in May-June (not Q4)
2. **Capacity planning:** EA team must allocate 60-70% capacity to capital planning (May-July)
3. **Proactive engagement:** Don't wait for business units to come to EA; actively shape pipeline
4. **Portfolio management:** Provide enterprise view, not just individual demand review
5. **Continuous improvement:** Learn from each capital cycle and optimize

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve revised Annual Engagement timing (May-June)
2. Communicate timing change to all business units (January)
3. Plan EA team capacity for Capital Planning Sprint (Q1)
4. Execute first Capital Planning Sprint (May-July)
5. Conduct lessons learned and optimize for next cycle (November)
