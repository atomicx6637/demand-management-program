# EA Demand Management - Intake Forms

This directory contains the intake forms for the Enterprise Architecture Demand Management Program. Use this guide to select the appropriate form for your investment request.

---

## Quick Form Selection

**Not sure which form to use?** Answer these three questions:

1. **What is your estimated total investment?**
   - Less than $50k → Use Enhancement Form
   - $50k - $2M → Tier 3 or Tier 2 (depends on complexity)
   - Over $2M → Tier 2 or Tier 1 (depends on complexity)

2. **What is your project complexity?**
   - **Low:** Single system, minimal integration, proven technology, single department
   - **Medium:** Multiple systems (2-4), moderate integration, cross-functional
   - **High:** Enterprise-wide, extensive integration (5+ systems), new technology, transformational

3. **Use the matrix below to find your tier**

## Project Tier Classification Matrix

| Investment Size | Low Complexity | Medium Complexity | High Complexity |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **<$50k** | Enhancement | Enhancement | Enhancement* |

| **$500k - $2M** | Tier 3 | Tier 2 | Tier 1 |
| **>$2M** | Tier 2 | Tier 1 | Tier 1 |

*High complexity enhancements may be re-tiered to Tier 2 during screening

## Complexity Assessment Guide

### Low Complexity Indicators
- Single application or system
- Minimal integration (1-2 systems or APIs)
- Proven, standard technology already in use
- Single department or function impacted
- Limited organizational change required
- Well-understood solution with low technical risk

**Examples:**
- Report/dashboard creation
- Minor system upgrade
- Single-system enhancement
- Workflow automation within one department

---

### Medium Complexity Indicators
- Multiple applications/systems involved (2-4)
- Moderate integration requirements
- Cross-functional impact (2-3 departments)
- Some new technology or vendor
- Moderate organizational/process change
- Manageable technical risk

**Examples:**
- Cross-system integration project
- Department-level process transformation
- New module implementation in existing platform
- Technology upgrade affecting multiple teams

---

### High Complexity Indicators
- Enterprise-wide systems or platforms
- Extensive integration (5+ systems) or enterprise data fabric
- Significant new technology introduction
- Cross-enterprise or customer-facing impact
- Substantial organizational transformation
- High technical risk or unproven solutions
- Major architectural implications

**Examples:**
- Core system replacement (ERP, CIS, SCADA)
- New platform introduction (customer portal, mobile platform)
- Digital transformation initiatives
- Enterprise architecture modernization
- Regulatory programs with enterprise impact

---

## Value Categories Framework

All projects must demonstrate value. The tier determines how many categories and the level of rigor required.

### 1. Operational Value
- Reliability improvement (SAIDI/SAIFI reduction)
- Efficiency gains (labor productivity, cycle time)
- Safety enhancement
- Asset performance improvement

### 2. Financial Value
- Cost avoidance
- Cost reduction
- Revenue generation
- Risk mitigation (quantified)

### 3. Customer Value
- Customer satisfaction improvement
- Service quality enhancement
- New customer services/capabilities
- Outage reduction

### 4. Regulatory/Compliance Value
- Regulatory mandate compliance
- Penalty/fine avoidance
- Compliance risk reduction
- Regulatory positioning

### 5. Strategic/Capability Value
- Strategic alignment to objectives
- New organizational capabilities
- Platform/option value

## Common Questions

### Q: What if I'm between two tiers?
**A:** When in doubt, submit to the higher tier. The EA screening process will validate and may adjust the tier classification. It's better to start higher and be moved down than to be under-prepared.

### Q: Can my project tier change during the process?
**A:** Yes. During screening, the EA team may re-tier your project based on complexity assessment, integration requirements, or strategic significance.

### Q: What if I don't know my exact costs?
**A:** Provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate. You can refine costs during the qualification process. Tier 3 and 2 intakes are intentionally lightweight.

### Q: Do I need executive sponsorship for Tier 3?
**A:** Not required for submission, but helpful. Tier 2 and Tier 1 require committed executive sponsors.

### Q: What if this is a regulatory mandate?
**A:** Regulatory mandates still go through tiered intake based on investment size and complexity. However, they may receive prioritized treatment and have different value thresholds (compliance is the value).

### Q: Can I submit multiple related projects together?
**A:** If projects are interdependent and create a program, consider Tier 1 Program Brief. If independent, submit separately at appropriate tiers.
