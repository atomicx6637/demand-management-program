## Executive Summary

This program establishes a value-based engagement framework that enables Quantum Energy to make faster, smarter investment decisions across all tiers of demand. The framework balances **speed and autonomy** for small investments with **strategic rigor** for large-scale initiatives, ensuring every dollar deployed demonstrates measurable business value.

### Core Philosophy

**"Push decisions to the lowest competent level while maintaining value guardrails and strategic oversight."**

### Expected Outcomes

- **Product teams autonomously manage Enhancement-tier investments** (<$50k) within 3 days
- **Right-sized governance** applied based on investment scale and strategic impact
- **All investments demonstrate clear value** through standardized measurement criteria
- **Efficient intake and screening** processes that accelerate good ideas and filter poor fits
- **90% stakeholder satisfaction** with demand process as enabling (not bureaucratic)

### Key Differentiators

This program introduces several innovative approaches to demand management:

1. **Interview-Based Qualification (Tier 2/3):** Submitters provide lightweight, high-level intake; EA team conducts recorded interviews to collaboratively develop detailed business cases. This shifts burden from sponsors to EA experts, improves quality, and accelerates cycle time.

2. **EA-Owned Demand Value Stream:** Enterprise Architecture team manages demand from intake through governance approval. PMO takes ownership at approval for project execution. Clear handoff eliminates confusion and optimizes each team's strengths.

3. **Federated Scalability Model:** Domain Architecture Representatives (DARs) manage Tier 3 qualification in their domains; EA team handles Tier 2/1. This distributes workload while maintaining quality and standards.

4. **Cost × Complexity Matrix Tiering:** Investment tier determined by both cost AND complexity, ensuring appropriate governance for high-complexity projects regardless of dollar amount.

### Investment Tier Framework

Investment tiers are determined using a **two-dimensional matrix** that considers both **Total Project Cost** and **Project Complexity**. This ensures that high-complexity projects receive appropriate governance rigor regardless of cost, while low-complexity projects can move faster even at higher dollar values.

#### Project Tier Classification Matrix

| **Total Project Cost** | **Low Complexity** | **Medium Complexity** | **High Complexity** |
| --------------------- |---------|--------|--------|
| **Over $2M** | Tier 2 | Tier 1 | Tier 1 |
| **$500k-$2M** | Tier 3 | Tier 2 | Tier 1 |
| **$50k-$500k** | Tier 3 | Tier 3 | Tier 2 |
| **<$50k** | Enhancement | Enhancement | Enhancement* |

*High-complexity Enhancements (<$50k) may be escalated to Tier 3 at DAR/EA discretion if architectural impact is significant.

#### Tier Characteristics Summary

| Tier | Classification Criteria | Decision Authority | Cycle Time Target | Value Rigor |
|------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Enhancement** | <$50k + Low/Med complexity | Product Team Lead + DAR | 3 days | Lightweight value assessment |
| **Tier 3** | $50k-$2M + Low complexity<br>OR $50k-$500k + Medium complexity | EA/DAR + Tech Subcommittee | 7-12 days | Standard business case with ROI |

## 1. Value-Based Investment Framework

### 1.1 Core Principles

**Principle 1: Value Demonstration is Universal**
Every investment, regardless of size, must articulate its value proposition. The **depth of analysis** scales with investment size, but the **requirement to demonstrate value** does not.

**Principle 2: Speed Enables Value**
Fast decisions on small investments compound into significant value. A 3-day Enhancement approval process captures opportunities that disappear in a 30-day review cycle.

**Principle 3: Strategic Investments Deserve Strategic Rigor**
Large, complex investments receive proportional analysis, stakeholder engagement, and architectural oversight. This rigor protects the organization from costly mistakes.

**Principle 4: Transparency Builds Trust**
All value criteria, decision-making processes, and approval rationale are transparent and accessible to stakeholders.

**Principle 5: Learning Loops Drive Improvement**
Post-implementation value realization tracking creates feedback loops that improve future investment decisions.

---

### 1.2 Value Categories for Utility Context

All investments are evaluated across five value categories relevant to utility operations:

#### 1. Operational Value
- **Reliability Improvement**: Reduction in SAIDI/SAIFI, outage duration, restoration time
- **Efficiency Gains**: Labor productivity, process automation, cycle time reduction
- **Safety Enhancement**: Worker safety metrics, public safety improvements, incident reduction
- **Asset Performance**: Equipment reliability, lifespan extension, performance optimization

#### 2. Financial Value
- **Cost Avoidance**: Deferred capital, reduced O&M, avoided penalties
- **Cost Reduction**: Labor savings, material cost reduction, vendor consolidation
- **Revenue Protection**: Reduced revenue leakage, improved collections, theft reduction
- **Revenue Growth**: New service offerings, market expansion, customer acquisition (non-regulated)

#### 3. Customer Value
- **Experience Improvement**: NPS increase, satisfaction scores, effort reduction
- **Service Enhancement**: New capabilities, faster response, expanded options
- **Reliability**: Fewer outages, faster restoration, better communication
- **Affordability**: Lower bills, payment flexibility, energy efficiency enablement

#### 4. Regulatory & Compliance Value

### 1.3 Project Complexity Definitions

Project complexity is assessed across multiple dimensions to ensure appropriate governance and architectural review. Complexity is classified as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** based on the following criteria:

#### Low Complexity
**Characteristics:**
- **Scope:** Single system or contained business process
- **Integration:** Minimal to no integration with other systems
- **Technology:** Mature, proven technology stack; minor upgrades or incremental changes
- **Organizational Impact:** Single department or business unit
- **Change Scope:** Limited process changes; primarily technical implementation
- **Risk Profile:** Low technical risk; well-understood solution patterns
- **Architecture:** Minimal architectural impact; fits within established patterns

**Examples:**
- Single-system minor version upgrade
- Standalone reporting or analytics enhancement
- Contained workflow automation within one domain
- Dashboard or portal enhancement using existing platform

#### Medium Complexity
**Characteristics:**
- **Scope:** Multiple systems or cross-functional business processes
- **Integration:** Moderate integration requirements (2-4 systems)
- **Technology:** Mix of proven and newer technologies; significant version upgrades
- **Organizational Impact:** Multiple departments or business units
- **Change Scope:** Moderate process redesign; organizational change management required
- **Risk Profile:** Moderate technical risk; some new solution patterns
- **Architecture:** Noteworthy architectural implications; may introduce new patterns or capabilities

**Examples:**
- Enterprise application major version upgrade
- Cross-system integration initiative
- New capability implementation using established technology
- Process automation spanning multiple departments
- Data migration or consolidation project

#### High Complexity
**Characteristics:**
- **Scope:** Enterprise-wide systems or transformational business processes
- **Integration:** Extensive integration requirements (5+ systems or enterprise data fabric)
- **Technology:** Significant new technology introduction; platform replacement; architectural shift
- **Organizational Impact:** Enterprise-wide or customer-facing
- **Change Scope:** Substantial process redesign; organizational transformation
- **Risk Profile:** High technical risk; unproven solution patterns or technology
- **Architecture:** Major architectural implications; new platforms, paradigm shifts, or strategic capabilities

**Examples:**
- Core system replacement (e.g., ERP, CIS, OMS, SCADA)
- New platform introduction (e.g., customer portal, mobile platform, IoT infrastructure)
- Digital transformation initiatives
- Enterprise architecture modernization (e.g., cloud migration, microservices adoption)
- Regulatory-driven programs with enterprise impact (e.g., NERC CIP compliance)

#### Complexity Assessment During Intake

Complexity is initially self-assessed by the demand submitter using guided questions in the intake form, then validated during the **Screening** phase by EA/DAR. If complexity is re-classified during screening, the demand may be **re-tiered** accordingly.

**Complexity Escalation Triggers:**
- Integration requirements exceed initial scope
- Architectural review identifies significant technical risk
- Organizational change scope broader than anticipated
- New technology introduces unforeseen complexity

## 4. Efficient Intake Process

### 4.1 Intake Philosophy

**Principle:** Make it easy to submit good ideas; make it clear what's needed; reduce rework through upfront clarity.

**Design Goals:**
- Single point of entry for all demand (ServiceNow portal or equivalent)
- Tier-appropriate intake forms (don't ask for Tier 1 detail on Enhancement)
- Contextual help and examples embedded in forms
- Auto-routing based on investment size and type
- Immediate confirmation and transparency on next steps

---

### 4.2 Unified Intake Portal

**Tool:** ServiceNow Demand Management Module (or equivalent IT Service Management platform)

**Features:**
- **Single Portal:** One entry point for all demand regardless of tier
- **Intelligent Form:** Dynamic form that adapts based on initial questions
- **Guided Intake:** Contextual help, examples, and tooltips throughout
- **Attachment Support:** Ability to upload supporting documents
- **Auto-Save:** Draft capability so requesters can complete over time
- **Status Tracking:** Requesters can see where their demand is in the process
- **Notification:** Automated alerts at each stage transition

---

### 4.3 Intake Form Design (Intelligent, Tiered)

**Step 1: Initial Classification (All Requesters)**

**Question 1: What type of work is this?**
- [ ] Break-Fix or Incident (Route to Incident Management process - outside demand workflow)
- [ ] Enhancement to existing system/process (<$50k expected)
- [ ] Project or Initiative ($50k+ expected)
- [ ] Not sure (Trigger intake consultation with EA)

**Question 2: What is the estimated total investment?** (For Enhancement or Project)
- [ ] Less than $50k
- [ ] $50k - $500k
- [ ] $500k - $2M
- [ ] Greater than $2M
- [ ] Unknown

**Question 3: What is the estimated project complexity?** [? Help tooltip with complexity definitions]
- [ ] **Low** - Single system, minimal integration, proven technology, single department
- [ ] **Medium** - Multiple systems, moderate integration (2-4 systems), cross-functional
- [ ] **High** - Enterprise-wide, extensive integration (5+ systems), new technology, transformational
- [ ] **Unsure** - Request PMO assistance

**Based on Questions 2 and 3, the system automatically routes to the appropriate form using the Project Tier Classification Matrix:**
- Enhancement Form: <$50k + Low/Medium complexity
- Tier 3 Form: As per matrix (e.g., $50k-$2M + Low, or $50k-$500k + Medium)
- Tier 2 Form: As per matrix (e.g., >$2M + Low, or $500k-$2M + Medium, or $50k-$500k + High)
- Tier 1 Form: As per matrix (e.g., >$2M + Medium/High, or $500k-$2M + High)
- If "Unsure" on complexity: Default to one tier higher for safety; re-tiered during screening

**Question 4: Requester Information**
- Name:
- Title:
- Department/Business Unit:
- Email:
- Phone:

**Step 2: Tier-Specific Intake Forms**

Based on answers to Step 1, requester is presented with appropriate intake form:

- **Additional Context:** [Anything else we should know?]

**What Happens Next:**
Upon submission, the EA team will:
1. **Screen** your submission with Strategic Planning Office (2-3 business days)
2. **Schedule an intake interview** (60 minutes) with you, executive sponsor, and key stakeholders
3. **Record the interview** and develop comprehensive demand documentation
4. **Update the demand record** with interview insights and develop formal business case outline
5. **Route to governance** for review and funding decision

**Submit Button:** Creates Tier 2 demand record; auto-routes to EA + Strategic Planning for screening and interview scheduling

---

#### 4.3.4 Tier 1 Program Intake Form (Program Brief)

**Format:** Structured template guiding requester to create 10-page Program Brief

- [ ] Is this a duplicate of existing demand or project?
- [ ] Is the request clear and understandable?
- [ ] Is the value articulation reasonable (not obviously inflated or unsupported)?
- [ ] Are there obvious red flags (e.g., cost estimate wildly unrealistic)?

**Screening Outcomes:**
- **Accept:** Proceed to next stage (qualification or architecture review)
- **Clarify:** Return to requester with specific questions (24-hour turnaround expected)
- **Re-tier:** Move to correct tier and notify requester
- **Redirect:** This is operational issue, not demand (route to appropriate process)
- **Reject:** Does not meet threshold (feedback provided; can be re-submitted)

**Target:** Screening complete within 1-2 business days of submission

---

## 5. Screening and Qualification Process

### 5.1 Screening Philosophy

**Purpose:** Protect downstream governance from poor-quality demands while not becoming a bottleneck

**Principles:**
- **Fast:** Screening complete in 1-2 days maximum
- **Helpful:** If demand is incomplete or unclear, provide specific guidance to requester
- **Consistent:** Apply same screening criteria regardless of who submitted or political pressure
- **Transparent:** Screening criteria and outcomes visible to all stakeholders
- **Enabling:** Goal is to improve quality, not to be gatekeepers

---

### 5.2 Screening Criteria by Tier

**Principle:** What gets measured gets managed. Systematic value tracking drives better investment decisions and organizational accountability.

**Measurement Approach:**
- **Baseline Measurement:** Establish current state metrics BEFORE investment
- **Target Setting:** Define specific, measurable targets for each value category
- **Periodic Tracking:** Measure progress quarterly (Tier 2/1) or sample basis (Enhancement/Tier 3)
- **Accountability:** Assign benefit owners responsible for realizing value
- **Course Correction:** Use variance from plan to trigger corrective actions
- **Learning:** Feed lessons from value realization back into future business cases

### 6.3 Value Realization Tracking Process

#### 6.3.1 Enhancement Value Tracking

**Approach:** Sample-based (10-15% of completed Enhancements quarterly)

**Process:**
1. **Sample Selection:** PMO randomly selects Enhancements across teams and value categories
2. **Value Check-In:** PMO schedules 15-minute call with product team
3. **Questions Asked:**
   - Did you complete this Enhancement?
   - What value did you expect? (Refresh from original submission)
   - What value did you actually realize?
   - Any lessons learned?
4. **Documentation:** Brief summary captured in demand record
5. **Aggregate Reporting:** Quarterly summary of Enhancement portfolio value

**Benefit:** Lightweight approach that validates Enhancement value framework without bureaucratic burden

---

#### 6.3.2 Tier 3 Value Tracking

**Approach:** All Tier 3 projects tracked; reporting quarterly

**Process:**
1. **Baseline Measurement:** At project kickoff, project manager confirms baseline metrics
2. **Target Confirmation:** Validate value targets from business case
3. **Quarterly Reporting:** Project manager reports value metrics quarterly during project
4. **Post-Implementation Tracking:** Quarterly tracking for 1 year post-go-live
5. **Value Realization Report:** Final report at 12 months post-implementation comparing actual vs. planned

**Accountability:**
- **Project Manager:** Responsible for tracking during project
- **Benefit Owner:** Business leader accountable for realizing value post-implementation
- **PMO:** Facilitates tracking and reporting

**Governance Touchpoint:** Quarterly value report included in PMO portfolio report to Technology Subcommittee

---

#### 6.3.3 Tier 2 Value Tracking

**Approach:** Rigorous tracking with executive visibility

**Process:**
1. **Value Realization Plan:** Developed during qualification; part of business case
2. **Baseline Measurement:** Formal baseline data collection before project start
3. **Benefits Owner Assignment:** Named business leader accountable for each benefit
4. **Monthly Tracking During Project:** Project steering committee reviews value metrics
5. **Post-Implementation Tracking:** Monthly for first 6 months; quarterly for next 18 months (total 2 years)
6. **Executive Review:** Semi-annual value realization review with executive sponsor

**Deliverables:**
- **Value Realization Dashboard:** Real-time dashboard showing value metrics vs. targets
- **Variance Reports:** When actual significantly differs from plan, benefit owner produces variance analysis and corrective action plan
- **Annual Value Report:** Comprehensive report on value realized vs. business case

**Governance Touchpoint:** Semi-annual deep dive with Technology Subcommittee on all Tier 2 projects' value realization

---

#### 6.3.4 Tier 1 Value Tracking

**Approach:** Comprehensive benefits management with board visibility

**Process:**
1. **Benefits Management Framework:** Formal framework established as part of program governance
2. **Benefits Register:** Comprehensive register of all benefits with owners, metrics, baselines, targets
3. **Baseline Data Collection:** Extensive data collection across all value categories before program start
4. **Quarterly Benefits Review:** Program steering committee reviews all benefit metrics
5. **Executive Sponsor Accountability:** Executive sponsor personally accountable to TAC/Board for value realization
6. **Multi-Year Tracking:** Quarterly tracking for life of program + 2-3 years post-completion
7. **Annual Board Reporting:** Program value realization report to Board annually

**Deliverables:**
- **Benefits Realization Dashboard:** Executive dashboard with real-time value metrics
- **Benefits Realization Reports:** Quarterly comprehensive reports to TAC
- **Annual Value Assessment:** External validation of value realized (for largest programs)
- **Lessons Learned Repository:** Extensive documentation for future program benefit

**Governance Touchpoint:**
- Quarterly: TAC reviews benefit realization as standing agenda item
- Annually: Board receives program value assessment
- Program gates: Value achievement vs. plan is gate criterion for continued funding

---

### 6.4 Value Realization Governance

#### Benefit Owner Accountability Model

**Benefit Owner Role:**
- Business leader (not project/program manager) accountable for realizing specific benefits
- Named in business case with explicit accountability
- Responsible for taking business actions necessary to realize value (e.g., process changes, adoption, capability use)
- Reports on benefit metrics according to tracking schedule

**Benefit Owner Responsibilities:**
- Validate benefit is achievable and measurement approach is feasible
- Collect baseline data before project
- Take actions post-implementation to realize benefit (not automatic)
- Report on benefit metrics according to schedule
- Produce variance analysis if benefit not realized
- Implement corrective actions to close value gaps

**Example:**
- **Project:** Customer portal modernization (Tier 2)
- **Benefit:** Reduce call center volume by 20% through self-service deflection
- **Benefit Owner:** VP Customer Service
- **Accountability:** VP Customer Service must promote portal adoption, train CSRs to direct customers to portal, measure call deflection, report quarterly, and take corrective action if call volume doesn't decline

---

#### Value Realization Reporting Cadence

| Tier | During Project | Post-Implementation | Executive Review | Board Reporting |
|------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Enhancement** | None (sample only) | Sample basis | Quarterly aggregate | Annual portfolio summary |
| **Tier 3** | Quarterly | Quarterly x 4 (1 year) | Semi-annual | Annual portfolio summary |
| **Tier 2** | Monthly (steering) | Monthly x 6, then quarterly x 6 (2 years) | Semi-annual deep dive | Annual portfolio summary |
| **Tier 1** | Monthly (program board) | Quarterly for duration + 2-3 years | Quarterly TAC standing item | Annual comprehensive report |

---

#### Course Correction Triggers

**When actual value significantly differs from plan, governance intervenes:**

**Variance Thresholds Triggering Review:**
- **Tier 3:** >30% variance from planned value at 1-year post-implementation
- **Tier 2:** >20% variance from planned value at any quarterly review
- **Tier 1:** >15% variance from planned value at any quarterly review

**Course Correction Process:**
1. **Benefit Owner Analysis:** Benefit owner produces root cause analysis of variance
2. **Corrective Action Plan:** Benefit owner proposes actions to close gap (or revise target if assumptions changed)
3. **Governance Review:** Technology Subcommittee (Tier 2/3) or TAC (Tier 1) reviews and approves corrective action plan
4. **Implementation:** Benefit owner implements corrective actions
5. **Follow-up:** Next period reporting includes progress on corrective actions

**Escalation:** If variance persists for 2+ consecutive periods, escalate to TAC for executive intervention

## 7. Gartner Prioritization Framework

### 7.1 Philosophy and Purpose

**Core Philosophy:** All investments are categorized to ensure alignment with strategic objectives and operational necessities. This framework, inspired by Gartner's model, provides a clear, qualitative approach to portfolio management, ensuring that resources are allocated to the most appropriate areas based on their contribution to the enterprise.

**Purpose:**
- To categorize investments into clear, understandable buckets that reflect their strategic intent.
- To facilitate portfolio balancing across different types of investment (e.g., mandatory vs. growth).
- To provide a common language for discussing and debating the merits of different initiatives.
- To ensure that non-discretionary work is clearly identified and managed, while discretionary investments are aligned with strategic goals.

---

### 7.2 Prioritization Categories

All initiatives are classified into one of four categories. This classification determines the funding approach, governance path, and portfolio treatment.

#### Category 1: Mandatory

**Description:** Investments required to comply with government regulations, industry standards, or legal mandates. This category also includes investments that are critical to business continuity, security, or financial reporting, where failure to invest would result in significant loss of income, legal penalties, or existential risk.

**Sub-categories:**
- **Compliance:** Fulfilling legal or regulatory requirements (e.g., NERC CIP, PUC orders, environmental standards).
- **Security:** Addressing critical security vulnerabilities or threats.
- **Criticality:** Preventing imminent failure of a mission-critical system or process; addressing significant delays in financial reporting.

**Portfolio Treatment:**
- **Funding:** Non-discretionary. These initiatives are funded first, before any discretionary investments are considered.
- **Governance:** Fast-tracked through governance for approval and execution. The focus is on *how* to deliver, not *if*.
- **Justification:** Justification is based on the mandate or critical business need, not on traditional ROI. The cost of *inaction* is the primary driver.

---

#### Category 2: Priority Development

**Description:** Discretionary investments focused on building the future business capabilities that will deliver a competitive advantage. These initiatives are about creating new value, entering new markets, or fundamentally changing how the business operates.

**Sub-categories:**
- **Transformation:** Creating new business models or fundamentally altering the enterprise's value proposition.
- **Core Differentiation:** Building unique capabilities that allow the business to stand out in the market.
- **Growth:** Expanding the business within the current business model (e.g., new products, new markets).

**Portfolio Treatment:**
- **Funding:** Discretionary, allocated from a strategic investment fund or portfolio. Competes with other Priority Development initiatives.
- **Governance:** Subject to rigorous business case evaluation, including strategic alignment, market analysis, and financial modeling (NPV, IRR).
- **Justification:** Based on long-term value creation, strategic fit, and potential for significant return on investment.

---

#### Category 3: Improvement

**Description:** Discretionary investments aimed at optimizing existing business processes, systems, and resources. The focus is on doing things better, faster, and cheaper.

**Sub-categories:**
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reducing personnel costs, increasing productivity, or streamlining workflows.
- **Capital Efficiency:** Reducing the need for hardware/software resources, leveraging economies of scale, or improving asset utilization.

**Portfolio Treatment:**
- **Funding:** Discretionary, often funded from an operational budget or a continuous improvement fund. Competes with other Improvement initiatives.
- **Governance:** Requires a solid business case with a clear and defensible ROI calculation (e.g., payback period, cost-benefit analysis).
- **Justification:** Based on measurable improvements in efficiency, cost reduction, or productivity.

---

#### Category 4: Maintenance

**Description:** Investments required to maintain the basic service level of IT systems and applications. This includes routine bug fixes, software upgrades, and hardware refreshes.

**Sub-categories:**
- **Bug Fixes:** Correcting defects in existing software.
- **Software Upgrades:** Applying patches, updates, or minor version upgrades to stay current and supported.
- **Hardware Refresh:** Replacing aging infrastructure to maintain performance and reliability.

**Portfolio Treatment:**
- **Funding:** Typically funded from a dedicated IT maintenance budget ("Keep the Lights On").
- **Governance:** Lightweight governance. Approval is often managed by the IT department or product teams within their allocated budgets.
- **Justification:** Based on the need to maintain system health, security, and supportability. Justification is often technical rather than business-focused.

---

### 7.3 Portfolio Allocation and Balancing

Instead of a numerical score, the Gartner framework uses the categories to guide portfolio allocation and balancing.

**Portfolio Balancing Process:**

**Step 1: Categorize All Demand**
All active demand (Enhancements through Tier 1) is assigned to one of the four categories during the intake and qualification process.

**Step 2: Allocate Budgets by Category**
Leadership allocates budget envelopes to each category based on strategic priorities for the planning period (e.g., Annual Operating Plan). A typical allocation might be:
- **Mandatory:** As required (unconstrained)
- **Maintenance:** 15-20% of IT budget
- **Improvement:** 30-40% of discretionary budget
- **Priority Development:** 50-60% of discretionary budget

**Step 3: Prioritize Within Categories**
Within each category, initiatives are prioritized based on relevant criteria:
- **Mandatory:** Prioritized by deadline or criticality. A regulatory deadline in 3 months is higher priority than one in 12 months.
- **Priority Development:** Prioritized based on strategic alignment, potential ROI, and market impact.
- **Improvement:** Prioritized based on ROI, payback period, or efficiency gain.
- **Maintenance:** Prioritized based on technical risk, end-of-life dates, or impact on system stability.

**Step 4: Apply Capacity and Make Decisions**
- **Mandatory & Maintenance:** Fund all initiatives until the budget for that category is exhausted.
- **Priority Development & Improvement:** Fund the highest-priority initiatives within each category until the budget for that category is exhausted. Initiatives "below the line" are deferred or rejected.

**Step 5: Executive Review**
The Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) reviews the categorized portfolio and the allocation decisions. The TAC has the authority to:
- Adjust budget allocations between categories based on shifting strategic priorities.
- Challenge the categorization of specific initiatives.
- Make final trade-off decisions for initiatives near the "funding line."

---

### 7.4 Integration with Demand Intake

**Integration with Intake Process:**

All demand intake forms (Enhancement through Tier 1) are updated to include a **Prioritization Category** section:

1.  **Select a Primary Category:**
    *   [ ] **Mandatory**
    *   [ ] **Priority Development**
    *   [ ] **Improvement**
    *   [ ] **Maintenance**

2.  **Select a Sub-category:** (Options appear based on the primary category selected)

3.  **Justification:** (Narrative field)
    *   Provide a brief explanation for why this initiative belongs in the selected category.
    *   For **Mandatory**, cite the specific regulation, security risk, or critical need.
    *   For **Priority Development**, link to strategic objectives.
    *   For **Improvement**, provide the expected efficiency or cost savings.
    *   For **Maintenance**, describe the technical need.

**Screening Impact:**
During the EA/DAR screening, the selected category is reviewed and validated.
- The category informs the level of rigor required for the business case.
- It sets expectations with the submitter about how their initiative will be evaluated and funded.
- It allows for early portfolio analysis and alignment with budget envelopes.

---

### 7.5 Governance Integration

**Enhancement Tier:**
- Most Enhancements will fall into the **Improvement** or **Maintenance** categories.
- The Product Team Lead prioritizes their backlog based on a mix of quick wins (Improvement) and essential fixes (Maintenance).

**Tier 3:**
- Tier 3 projects are typically in the **Improvement** or **Maintenance** categories.
- The Technology Subcommittee reviews these initiatives and prioritizes them based on ROI or technical need against the allocated budget for that category.

**Tier 2:**
- Tier 2 projects are often in the **Priority Development** or **Improvement** categories.
- The TAC reviews these initiatives, ensuring they align with the strategic goals for that category and fit within the allocated budget.

**Tier 1:**
- Tier 1 programs are almost exclusively in the **Priority Development** or **Mandatory** categories.
- These are reviewed by the TAC and the Board with a focus on strategic impact and long-term value creation.

---

### 7.6 Prioritization Example

**Scenario:** Three Tier 3 initiatives competing for limited discretionary budget:

| Initiative | Cost | Category | Justification |
|------------|------|----------|---------------|
| **A: Fleet GPS Tracking** | $150k | Improvement | "Reduce fuel costs by 10% and overtime by 5% through route optimization and better tracking. Expected payback in 18 months." |
| **B: NERC CIP Compliance Audit Tool** | $250k | Mandatory | "Required to meet NERC CIP v6 audit requirements by Q3. Failure to comply will result in significant fines." |
| **C: Customer Portal V2 - Mobile App** | $400k | Priority Development | "Create a new mobile app to improve customer engagement (target 20% increase in digital interaction) and differentiate our service from competitors."|

**Analysis:**

**Initiative B (NERC CIP Compliance):**
- **Category:** Mandatory
- **Portfolio Treatment:** Funded from the non-discretionary "Mandatory" budget. This initiative is not in competition with A and C for discretionary funds. It will be funded and fast-tracked.

**Initiative C (Customer Portal V2):**
- **Category:** Priority Development
- **Portfolio Treatment:** Competes for the "Priority Development" budget. It will be evaluated against other strategic initiatives based on its potential to increase customer engagement and provide a competitive advantage.

**Initiative A (Fleet GPS Tracking):**
- **Category:** Improvement
- **Portfolio Treatment:** Competes for the "Improvement" budget. It will be evaluated against other improvement projects based on its 18-month payback period and expected cost savings.

**Decision:**
- Initiative B is funded automatically from the Mandatory budget.
- The TAC will then decide how to allocate the remaining discretionary budget between the "Priority Development" and "Improvement" categories.
- Initiative C will be ranked against other "Priority Development" projects.
- Initiative A will be ranked against other "Improvement" projects.

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities

### 9.0 Demand Management Operating Model

#### Value Stream Ownership and Transition Points

The **Enterprise Architecture (EA) team** is responsible for managing the demand value stream from intake through governance approval. The **PMO team** owns execution from project kickoff through delivery and value realization. This creates a clear handoff between demand management (EA-led) and delivery management (PMO-led).

**EA Team Ownership:**
- Demand intake and screening (all tiers)
- Interview facilitation and business case development (Tier 2/3)
- Architectural review and complexity validation (all tiers)
- Governance preparation and presentation support
- Demand-to-delivery transition

**PMO Team Ownership:**
- Project/program execution (all tiers, post-approval)
- Resource management and delivery tracking
- Value realization monitoring and reporting
- Supporting roles during qualification (financial modeling, planning support)

**Transition Point:** When a demand receives funding approval from governance (Tech Sub for Tier 3, TAC for Tier 2/1), EA transitions accountability to PMO for execution.

---

#### 9.0.1 Demand Management Scalability Model

The EA team cannot manage every demand submission individually. The following model ensures scalability by distributing responsibility based on tier and complexity:

| Tier | Volume (Estimated Annual) | EA Management Approach | Scalability Strategy |
|------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Enhancement** | 200-300/year | **Product Team-Managed** with DAR oversight | Product Team Leads own screening, approval, tracking. DAR provides architectural consultation on request. EA spot-checks 10-15% quarterly. |
| **Tier 3** | 60-80/year | **DAR-Led** with EA oversight | Domain Architecture Representatives (DARs) facilitate interviews, develop business cases, and manage qualification. EA team provides templates, quality review, and handles escalations. |
| **Tier 2** | 15-25/year | **EA-Led** with Strategic Planning partnership | Senior EA team members facilitate interviews and lead qualification. Strategic Planning co-facilitates. PMO and Finance provide analysis support. |
| **Tier 1** | 3-8/year | **EA + Strategy Office Co-Led** | EA leads architecture and technical components. Strategy Office leads strategic alignment and executive engagement. Full cross-functional team assembled. |

**Key Scalability Mechanisms:**

1. **Federated Model for Tier 3:** DARs (embedded in domains) handle majority of Tier 3 volume locally
   - **Capacity:** Each DAR can manage 8-12 Tier 3 demands/year (3-4 hours per demand)
   - **Coverage:** 6-8 DARs across domains = 48-96 Tier 3 capacity annually
   - **EA Oversight:** Quarterly quality reviews, template updates, escalation support

2. **Centralized for Tier 2:** EA team centrally manages higher-complexity, higher-value demands
   - **Capacity:** 3-4 senior EA staff at 8-12 hours per Tier 2 = 15-25 Tier 2 capacity annually
   - **Support:** Strategic Planning co-facilitates; PMO and Finance provide analytical support

3. **Managed Team Approach for Tier 1:** Full cross-functional qualification team per program
   - **Leadership:** Assigned Program Director + EA architect + Strategy Office lead
   - **Capacity:** 3-8 Tier 1 programs = sustainable load for organization

**Demand Management Capacity:**

| Role | Annual Capacity | Focus |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Product Team Leads** (12-15 teams) | 200-300 Enhancements | Self-managed small investments |
| **Domain Architecture Representatives** (6-8 DARs) | 48-96 Tier 3 projects | Federated demand qualification |
| **Senior EA Team** (3-4 architects) | 15-25 Tier 2 projects | Complex, strategic demands |
| **EA + Strategy Office** (dedicated per program) | 3-8 Tier 1 programs | Transformational programs |

**Total Organizational Capacity:** 250-430 demands/year across all tiers

**Overflow and Surge Management:**
- If Tier 3 volume exceeds DAR capacity: EA team temporarily supplements or defers lower-priority demands
- If Tier 2 volume surges: Strategic Planning may facilitate additional interviews; PMO increases analytical support
- Portfolio planning (annual) aligns expected demand with available qualification capacity

- **Consistent:** Same rules apply regardless of who submits or political influence
- **Timely:** Decisions made within target cycle times
- **Enabling:** Governance helps improve ideas and finds ways to "yes" when value is present
- **Accountable:** Decision makers are accountable for outcomes
- **Learning:** Governance incorporates feedback and continuously improves

**Business Sponsors:**
- Message: "We're helping you articulate and demonstrate the value of your investments"
- Communication: Sponsor onboarding sessions, business case development support
- Engagement: EA partnership, templates and tools, intake consultation

**Product Team Leads:**
- Message: "You have more autonomy and speed on small investments, with clear value guardrails"
- Communication: Product team training, Enhancement process walkthrough, DAR introduction
- Engagement: Pilot feedback, ongoing support, celebrate early successes

**Project Managers:**
- Message: "Clearer value criteria and better tools to develop strong business cases"
- Communication: PM community sessions, template training, value tracking process
- Engagement: PMO support network, lessons learned sharing

**EA and DARs:**
- Message: "Your role is to enable value while maintaining architectural integrity"

|------------|--------|------------|
| "This is too much process/bureaucracy" | Project sponsors | Emphasize speed targets; show cycle time improvements; enable, not block |
| "We don't have time for value quantification" | Busy teams | Provide tools and support; start simple; show value of discipline |
| "Product teams will make bad decisions" | EA, governance | Data from pilot; DAR oversight; quality audits; trust but verify |
| "Our projects are different/unique" | Special interests | Apply criteria consistently; exceptions available but require justification |
| "Value is too hard to measure" | Skeptics | Start with available metrics; improve over time; something is better than nothing |
| "Governance will slow us down" | Agile/fast teams | Show cycle time targets; Enhancement autonomy; remove bottlenecks |
