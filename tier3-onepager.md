## What Qualifies as Tier 3?

✅ **Your project should be submitted as Tier 3 if it meets:**

**Cost + Complexity Matrix:**
- **$50k-$2M + Low Complexity**, OR
- **$50k-$500k + Medium Complexity**

**Project Characteristics:**
- Discrete project with defined scope and deliverables
- May involve multiple systems or business processes
- Some architectural considerations
- Value realization within 12-18 months

**Examples:**
- GPS tracking system implementation for fleet management
- Middleware platform upgrade
- Proof-of-concept for new technology
- Single-system replacement or modernization
- Operational technology system enhancement

## Complexity Assessment Guide

**Low Complexity:**
- Single system or contained process
- Minimal integration (1-2 systems)
- Proven technology
- Single department impact

**Medium Complexity:**
- Multiple systems (2-4 integrations)
- Cross-functional impact
- Mix of proven and new technology
- Moderate process redesign

**High Complexity** → Should be Tier 2:
- Enterprise-wide impact
- Extensive integration (5+ systems)
- New technology introduction
- Transformational change

## How to Submit - **Interview-Based Process**

### **Step 1: Submit High-Level Intake (5-10 minutes)**

Go to ServiceNow → **Submit Demand Request** → Select **"Tier 3 Project"**

**You'll complete a simple 1-page form:**
- Project title and contact information
- Strategic objective alignment
- Estimated cost and complexity (Low/Medium)
- High-level business need (3-5 sentences)
- Who will benefit?
- High-level solution overview (2-3 sentences)
- Systems/platforms likely involved
- Expected value categories (check boxes with brief descriptions)
- Desired timeline

**That's it! No lengthy business case required at this stage.**

---

### **Step 2: EA Team Schedules Interview**

**Within 1-2 business days**, EA team will:
- Screen your submission
- Schedule a **30-45 minute interview** with you (and key stakeholders)
- Send you interview prep guide

---

### **Step 3: Participate in Interview (30-45 minutes)**

**EA facilitator will ask about:**
- Business need deep dive
- Solution approach and alternatives
- Value across all 5 categories
- Complexity and feasibility
- Risks and constraints

**The interview is recorded** (Teams/Zoom with transcription) so EA can develop comprehensive documentation.

---

### **Step 4: EA Develops Your Business Case**

**You don't write the business case - EA does!**

EA team will:
- Review interview recording
- Draft 5-7 page Tier 3 Business Case using template
- Add architectural analysis
- Develop rough financial model (with Finance support if needed)
- Share draft with you for validation

**Your role:** Review draft and confirm accuracy (15-minute call or async)

---

### **Step 5: Governance Review**

**Technology Subcommittee** (bi-weekly) reviews your business case and recommends to TAC
**TAC** (monthly) makes funding decision

**You'll be invited to present** (typically 10-15 minutes)

---

## Timeline: 7-12 Business Days from Submission to Governance-Ready

| Phase | Duration | Your Involvement |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Screening | 1-2 days | None - EA handles |
| Interview Scheduling | 2-5 days | Confirm availability |
| Interview | 30-45 min | Active participation |
| Business Case Development | 3-4 days | Review draft (15 min) |
| Quality Review & Routing | 1 day | None - EA handles |
| **Total** | **7-12 days** | **~2 hours total** |

**Then add:** Tech Subcommittee review (bi-weekly cycle) + TAC decision (monthly cycle)

---

## Decision Criteria - Will Your Project Be Approved?

### **Value Threshold:**
✅ Must demonstrate positive value in **TWO OR MORE** categories:
1. **Operational:** Efficiency, reliability, safety improvements
2. **Financial:** Cost savings, cost avoidance, revenue protection
3. **Customer:** Experience, satisfaction, service improvements
4. **Regulatory/Compliance:** Compliance, risk reduction, audit support
5. **Strategic/Capability:** Strategic alignment, capability building

✅ Quantified benefits with supporting assumptions
✅ Simple ROI calculation (payback period or NPV)
✅ Benefits exceed costs within 3 years

### **Other Criteria:**
✅ Clear business need
✅ Architecturally feasible
✅ Funding source identified
✅ Executive sponsor committed (or identified)
✅ Not a duplicate

## Common Reasons for Re-Tiering or Rejection

🔄 **Re-tiered to Enhancement:** Cost <$50k and low complexity
🔄 **Re-tiered to Tier 2:** Complexity higher than initially assessed (e.g., 6+ system integrations, new technology)
❌ **Rejected:** Insufficient value articulation
❌ **Rejected:** Duplicate of existing project
❌ **Rejected:** Architecturally infeasible or conflicts with standards
❌ **Tabled:** Right idea, wrong timing

---

## After Approval - Transition to Delivery

Once TAC approves your project:

1. **EA Transitions to EPMO** - Handoff from demand to delivery
2. **Project Manager Assigned** - EPMO assigns PM to your project
3. **Project Charter Created** - Detailed planning begins
4. **Execution Starts** - Your project is underway!
5. **Value Tracking** - Quarterly tracking of value realization

---

## What Makes a Great Tier 3 Submission?

### **DO:**
✅ **Be honest about complexity** - EA will validate during interview anyway
✅ **Quantify value** - "Save $150k/year in O&M costs" beats "reduce costs"
✅ **Identify sponsor** - Executive sponsorship matters
✅ **Attach supporting docs** - Vendor quotes, requirements, diagrams help
✅ **Be available for interview** - Your participation is critical

### **DON'T:**
❌ **Write a detailed business case** - EA will do this from your interview
❌ **Lowball complexity** - This causes re-tiering and delays
❌ **Skip value quantification** - "This would be nice" won't get approved
❌ **Submit duplicate requests** - Check existing portfolio first
