## Executive Summary

This engagement model establishes a **proactive, relationship-based approach** to demand management that positions Enterprise Architecture as a strategic business partner, not just a governance gatekeeper. Through structured, regular engagement with business units, EA and DARs:

**Key Objectives:**
- **Shape demand early:** Engage with business stakeholders before formal demand submission to improve quality and strategic alignment
- **Build relationships:** Establish EA as trusted advisor and strategic partner to business units
- **Improve pipeline visibility:** Understand upcoming business needs 3-6 months before formal submission
- **Reduce rework:** Catch issues early (misalignment, duplication, scope gaps) before significant investment in business cases
- **Strategic influence:** Position technology investments to enable business strategy, not just respond to requests

**Engagement Philosophy:**

*"Engage early, engage often, add value every time."*

Traditional demand management is **reactive** (wait for demand, review, approve/reject). This model is **proactive** (understand business context, shape opportunities, guide investments).

**Engagement Cadence:**
- **Annual:** Strategic planning and capability roadmap alignment
- **Quarterly:** Portfolio reviews and demand pipeline discussions
- **Monthly:** Capability-focused working sessions (for high-priority domains)
- **Ad-Hoc:** Emerging needs, strategic initiatives, problem-solving

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 80% of Tier 2/1 demands engaged by EA before formal submission
- 50% reduction in demand rework due to early shaping
- Business stakeholder satisfaction with EA partnership >4.5/5.0
- EA positioned as strategic enabler (not bureaucratic blocker)

## 1. Engagement Model Overview

### 1.1 Engagement Philosophy & Principles

**Principle 1: Proactive, Not Reactive**
EA doesn't wait for demands to arrive. We proactively engage with business units to understand their strategic priorities, challenges, and opportunities, then help shape technology investments.

**Principle 2: Business-Focused, Not Technology-Focused**
Engagements start with business context (strategy, goals, challenges), not technology solutions. Technology is positioned as enabler, not driver.

**Principle 3: Value-Adding, Not Bureaucratic**
Every engagement must deliver tangible value to the business unit. If we're not helping them succeed, we're wasting their time.

**Principle 4: Relationship-Based, Not Transactional**
EA builds trusted advisor relationships through consistent, helpful engagement over time. Trust enables early collaboration and honest dialogue.

**Principle 5: Tailored, Not One-Size-Fits-All**
Engagement frequency, format, and content are tailored to business unit size, strategic importance, and maturity.

### 1.2 Engagement Model Structure

The engagement model operates on **four rhythms** (Annual, Quarterly, Monthly, Ad-Hoc), each serving a distinct purpose:

```
ENGAGEMENT RHYTHM HIERARCHY

ANNUAL ENGAGEMENT (Strategic Alignment)
├─ Purpose: Align EA and business unit on strategic priorities and capability roadmap
├─ Participants: CIO/CTO, EA Leadership, Business Unit Executive, Strategy Office
├─ Duration: 2-3 hours
└─ Outcomes: Shared strategic roadmap, capability investment priorities, demand pipeline outline

    ↓

QUARTERLY BUSINESS REVIEWS (Portfolio & Pipeline)
├─ Purpose: Review portfolio health, discuss upcoming demand pipeline, address issues
├─ Participants: EA Lead, DAR, Business Unit Director, Key Managers
├─ Duration: 1.5-2 hours
└─ Outcomes: Updated demand pipeline, portfolio adjustments, issue resolution

    ↓

MONTHLY CAPABILITY WORKING SESSIONS (Tactical Collaboration)
├─ Purpose: Collaborative problem-solving on specific capabilities, initiatives, or demands
├─ Participants: DAR, Business Unit Managers, Subject Matter Experts
├─ Duration: 1 hour
└─ Outcomes: Demand shaping, technical feasibility, architecture guidance

    ↓

AD-HOC STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENTS (Responsive)
├─ Purpose: Respond to emerging needs, urgent issues, or strategic opportunities
├─ Participants: Variable (based on need)
├─ Duration: Variable
└─ Outcomes: Rapid response, problem resolution, opportunity capture
```

### 1.3 Engagement Lifecycle Integration

Engagements are **integrated with the demand lifecycle** to maximize impact:

```
DEMAND LIFECYCLE + ENGAGEMENT TOUCHPOINTS

Pre-Demand (3-6 months before submission):
├─ ANNUAL ENGAGEMENT: Identify strategic needs and capability gaps
├─ QUARTERLY REVIEW: Surface emerging opportunities in demand pipeline
└─ MONTHLY SESSION: Shape demand concept, validate feasibility
    ↓
    [VALUE: Demand is well-formed, strategically aligned, and feasible before submission]

Demand Intake (Month 0):
├─ EA/DAR already aware of demand (no surprises)
├─ Screening is faster (context already understood)
└─ Strategic alignment pre-validated
    ↓
    [VALUE: Faster intake, fewer rejections, less rework]

Qualification (Weeks 1-2):
├─ MONTHLY SESSION: Collaborate on business case development
├─ EA facilitates intake interview (already has relationship)
└─ Business case leverages pre-work from engagements
    ↓
    [VALUE: Higher quality business cases, less back-and-forth]

Architecture Review (Weeks 2-3):
├─ Architecture approach already socialized in monthly sessions
├─ Organizational readiness already assessed
└─ Fewer surprises, smoother review
    ↓
    [VALUE: Faster architecture review, fewer conditions]

Governance (Week 4+):
├─ QUARTERLY REVIEW: Business unit aware of portfolio prioritization context
├─ EA and business unit aligned on priority and justification
└─ Joint presentation to governance (partnership, not adversarial)
    ↓
    [VALUE: Better governance outcomes, aligned expectations]

Post-Approval (Ongoing):
├─ MONTHLY SESSION: Track project progress, address issues
├─ QUARTERLY REVIEW: Benefits realization tracking
└─ Continuous partnership through execution
    ↓
    [VALUE: Successful delivery, value realized, lessons learned]
```

**Key Insight:** Early engagement shifts EA from **demand reviewer** to **demand co-creator**, resulting in higher quality demands and better outcomes.

## 7. Business Unit Segmentation & Tailoring

### 7.1 Segmentation Approach

Not all business units require the same level of engagement. Segment business units to **tailor engagement intensity**:

**Segmentation Criteria:**
1. **Strategic Importance:** How critical is this BU to enterprise strategy?
2. **Demand Volume:** How many demands does this BU typically submit?
3. **Investment Level:** What is typical annual IT investment for this BU?
4. **Complexity:** How complex are this BU's technology needs?
5. **Relationship Maturity:** How mature is EA's relationship with this BU?

**Segmentation Tiers:**

#### Tier 1 Business Units (Strategic Partners)

**Characteristics:**
- High strategic importance to enterprise
- High demand volume (>5 Tier 2/1 demands per year)
- Large IT investment (>$5M annually)
- Complex technology landscape
- Executive-level relationship with EA

**Examples:**
- Customer Operations
- Grid Operations
- Energy Delivery
- Regulatory & Compliance

**Engagement Model:**
- ✅ Annual Strategic Engagement (Executive level)
- ✅ Quarterly Business Reviews (Director level)
- ✅ Monthly Working Sessions (Tactical)
- ✅ Ad-Hoc as needed
- **Assigned EA:** Dedicated senior EA
- **Assigned DAR:** Primary DAR with deep domain knowledge

---

#### Tier 2 Business Units (Active Collaborators)

**Characteristics:**
- Moderate strategic importance
- Moderate demand volume (2-5 Tier 2/1 demands per year)
- Moderate IT investment ($1M-$5M annually)
- Moderate complexity
- Established relationship with EA

**Examples:**
- Workforce Management
- Supply Chain & Procurement
- Financial Management
- Asset Management

**Engagement Model:**
- ✅ Annual Strategic Engagement (Director level)
- ✅ Quarterly Business Reviews (Manager level)
- ✅ Monthly Working Sessions (on-demand, not standing)
- ✅ Ad-Hoc as needed
- **Assigned EA/DAR:** Shared EA/DAR across 2-3 BUs

---

#### Tier 3 Business Units (Supported)

**Characteristics:**
- Lower strategic importance (internal/support functions)
- Low demand volume (<2 Tier 2/1 demands per year)
- Low IT investment (<$1M annually)
- Lower complexity (mostly Enhancement tier)
- Transactional relationship with EA

**Examples:**
- Human Resources
- Legal & Compliance
- Facilities Management
- Corporate Communications

**Engagement Model:**
- ✅ Annual Strategic Engagement (Manager level, 1-hour format)
- ⚠️ Quarterly Business Reviews (bi-annual instead of quarterly)
- ❌ Monthly Working Sessions (ad-hoc only when demand is active)
- ✅ Ad-Hoc as needed
- **Assigned EA/DAR:** DAR covers multiple Tier 3 BUs

---

### 7.2 Tailoring Engagement Intensity

**Scaling Engagement by Tier:**

| Engagement Element | Tier 1 BU | Tier 2 BU | Tier 3 BU |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Annual Engagement** | 3 hours, Executive level | 2 hours, Director level | 1 hour, Manager level |
| **QBR Frequency** | Quarterly (4x/year) | Quarterly (4x/year) | Bi-annual (2x/year) |
| **QBR Duration** | 2 hours | 1.5 hours | 1 hour |
| **Monthly Sessions** | Standing monthly | On-demand | Ad-hoc only |
| **Assigned EA** | Dedicated senior EA | Shared EA (2-3 BUs) | DAR (multiple BUs) |
| **Proactive Outreach** | Weekly/bi-weekly touchpoints | Monthly touchpoints | As needed |
| **EA Time Commitment** | 20-30% FTE | 10-15% FTE | 5-10% FTE |

**Dynamic Adjustment:**
- Business units can move between tiers based on changing strategic importance or demand volume
- Temporary "tier elevation" for specific strategic initiatives (e.g., Tier 2 BU with Tier 1 program gets Tier 1 engagement during program)

---

### 10.4 Handling Difficult Relationships

**Common Relationship Challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Business Unit Sees EA as Blocker**
- **Symptoms:** BU avoids EA until forced to engage; negative perception
- **Root Cause:** EA has historically said "no" without offering alternatives; slow reviews
- **Remediation:**
  - Acknowledge past challenges; commit to partnership approach
  - Shift to "yes, and..." (offer alternatives instead of rejection)
  - Demonstrate value through quick wins
  - Over-communicate and be highly responsive

**Challenge 2: BU Doesn't See Value in EA Engagement**
- **Symptoms:** Low engagement; skipped meetings; minimal preparation
- **Root Cause:** EA hasn't demonstrated tangible value; engagements feel like status meetings
- **Remediation:**
  - Explicitly ask: "What would make our engagement more valuable to you?"
  - Tailor engagement format to their needs
  - Focus on solving real problems they face
  - Share success stories from other BUs (with permission)

**Challenge 3: Poor Communication or Misalignment**
- **Symptoms:** Surprises; demands submitted without EA awareness; misunderstandings
- **Root Cause:** Infrequent engagement; unclear communication channels
- **Remediation:**
  - Increase engagement frequency (more touchpoints)
  - Establish clear communication channels (email, Teams, etc.)
  - Over-communicate; assume nothing
  - Actively listen and paraphrase to confirm understanding

**Challenge 4: BU Resistant to EA Guidance**
- **Symptoms:** BU ignores EA recommendations; demands bypass architecture review
- **Root Cause:** BU doesn't trust EA expertise; EA perceived as out of touch with business reality
- **Remediation:**
  - Build credibility through demonstrating business acumen
  - Involve BU in architecture decisions (collaborate, don't dictate)
  - Explain rationale for recommendations (link to business outcomes)
  - Be flexible where possible; save "hard no" for true risks

**Escalation:**
If relationship challenges persist despite remediation efforts, escalate to EA Leadership for support and potential leadership-to-leadership conversation.

## Conclusion

This Business Unit Engagement Model transforms EA from a **reactive gatekeeper** to a **proactive strategic partner**. By engaging with business units early and often through structured rhythms (Annual, Quarterly, Monthly, Ad-Hoc), EA:

✅ **Shapes demand before formal submission** → Higher quality, better aligned, faster approvals
✅ **Builds trusted advisor relationships** → Open dialogue, early collaboration, strategic influence
✅ **Gains pipeline visibility** → Proactive planning, resource allocation, portfolio optimization
✅ **Reduces rework and friction** → Issues caught early, feasibility validated upfront
✅ **Positions technology as strategic enabler** → EA helps business units win, not just governs

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Executive Sponsorship:** CIO/CTO commitment to engagement model
2. **EA/DAR Capability:** Training and support for relationship management and engagement facilitation
3. **BU Engagement:** Business units see value and commit time to partnership
4. **Discipline & Consistency:** Maintain engagement rhythms even when busy
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Learn from each engagement; optimize over time

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and tailor this engagement model for Quantum Energy context
2. Gain executive approval and sponsorship (CIO/CTO)
3. Segment business units and assign EA/DAR ownership
4. Pilot with 2-3 Tier 1 BUs
5. Roll out to all Tier 1/2 BUs based on pilot success
