## High Complexity Characteristics

**What Makes a Program "High Complexity"?**

✅ **Scope:** Enterprise-wide systems or transformational business processes
✅ **Integration:** Extensive integration (5+ systems or enterprise data fabric)
✅ **Technology:** Significant new technology introduction; platform replacement; architectural shift

## How to Submit - **Strategic Program Development Process**

### **This is NOT a Web Form**

Tier 1 intake is a **collaborative, strategic process** involving Strategy Office, EA, and Executive Leadership.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Consultation with Strategic Planning Office**

**Before formal submission:**
- Contact Strategic Planning Office to discuss your strategic initiative
- 60-90 minute exploratory discussion
- Assess strategic fit, timing, and readiness
- Determine if Tier 1 is appropriate classification

**Strategic Planning helps you:**
- Articulate strategic imperative
- Identify executive sponsor (ELT-level)
- Assess organizational readiness
- Understand governance timeline (6-12 weeks minimum)

---

### **Step 2: Develop Program Brief (2-4 Weeks)**

**Download Program Brief Template** from Knowledge Base

**Program Brief Components (10 pages):**
1. **Executive Summary** (1 page) - Strategic imperative, investment ask, expected value
2. **Strategic Context and Imperative** (2 pages) - Why now? Why this? Competitive/regulatory drivers
3. **Business Need and Opportunity** (2 pages) - Current state problems, future state vision
4. **Proposed Program Approach** (2 pages) - High-level solution, phases, major workstreams
5. **Expected Value and Benefits** (2 pages) - Transformational value across ALL FIVE categories
6. **High-Level Cost Estimate and Funding** (1 page) - Multi-year investment profile
7. **Risks and Dependencies** (1 page) - Major risks, organizational dependencies
8. **Next Steps and Decision Requested** (1 page) - Gate 0 approval, business case investment

**You Work With:**
- **Strategy Office** (mandatory partnership) - Strategic positioning, executive alignment
- **EA Team** - High-level architectural feasibility
- **Finance** - Rough order of magnitude cost estimates
- **Executive Sponsor** - Strategic messaging, organizational readiness

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to develop Program Brief (depends on complexity and readiness)

---

### **Step 3: Submit Program Brief**

**Email submission to:** [tier1-intake@quantumenergy.com](mailto:tier1-intake@quantumenergy.com)

**EA/Strategy Office:**
- Creates demand record in ServiceNow
- Initiates Gate 0: Strategic Alignment review
- Schedules Gate 0 meeting with CIO/CTO and relevant executives

---

### **Step 4: Gate 0 - Strategic Alignment Review (5-7 Days)**

**Purpose:** Determine if this program warrants full business case development investment

**Reviewers:**
- Strategic Planning Office (lead)
- CIO/CTO
- Relevant Executive Sponsor(s)
- EA Team
- CFO (for financial feasibility)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✅ **Strategic Imperative:** Mission-critical? Board priority? Clear strategic driver?
- ✅ **Executive Sponsorship:** ELT sponsor fully committed and appropriate?
- ✅ **Timing and Urgency:** Right time to invest? Organizational readiness?
- ✅ **Feasibility:** High confidence in deliverability? Architectural feasibility?
- ✅ **Investment Readiness:** Ready for 4-8 week business case development effort?

**Gate 0 Outcomes:**
- **✅ Proceed to Full Business Case** - Authorize 4-8 week comprehensive business case development
- **⏸ Table for Future Consideration** - Good idea, wrong timing; revisit in 6-12 months
- **❌ Reject or Fundamentally Re-scope** - Does not meet strategic threshold

---

### **Step 5: Comprehensive Business Case Development (4-8 Weeks)**

**If Gate 0 approves, you establish Program Office:**

**Program Team:**
- **Program Director** (hired or assigned to lead)
- **EA Architect(s)** (dedicated to program)
- **Strategy Office Lead** (strategic alignment and executive engagement)
- **Finance Program Accountant** (multi-year financial modeling)
- **EPMO Support** (program management methodology)
- **External Consultants** (if needed for specialized expertise)

**Deliverables (30-50 pages + appendices):**
- Comprehensive Program Charter
- Future State Architecture (target state and migration plan)
- Multi-year financial model with scenario analysis
- Organizational transformation plan
- Risk and benefits management framework
- Stakeholder engagement strategy
- Executive socialization materials

**This is a 4-8 week EFFORT, not timeline** - Calendar time may be 8-16 weeks with stakeholder engagement

---

### **Step 6: Multi-Gate Governance Process**

**Gate 1:** EA Architecture Review (formal architecture approval)

**Gate 2:** Technology Subcommittee Deep Dive (2-hour session, detailed review)

**Gate 3:** ELT Pre-Briefing (individual briefings with each ELT member)

**Gate 4:** TAC Authorization (funding and capacity approval)

**Gate 5:** Board Approval (if >$10M or strategic imperative requires Board)

**You will present at each gate** - extensive executive engagement required

## Decision Criteria - Transformational Value Required

### **Value Threshold - Transformational Value Required**

Tier 1 must demonstrate **transformational value across all value categories**:

1. **Operational Value:**
   - Major reliability improvements (SAIDI/SAIFI)
   - Significant efficiency gains (>20% improvement)
   - Transformational safety or asset performance
   - Quantified over multi-year horizon

2. **Financial Value:**
   - Comprehensive financial model (NPV, IRR, payback, scenario analysis)
   - Multi-year cash flow projections
   - Risk-adjusted returns
   - Typically $10M+ NPV over program life

3. **Customer Value:**
   - Transformational customer experience improvement
   - Measurable NPS, satisfaction, or effort reduction
   - New customer capabilities or service offerings
   - Competitive differentiation

4. **Regulatory & Compliance Value:**
   - Major compliance achievement (NERC CIP, PUC mandates)
   - Significant risk reduction (avoid penalties, audit findings)
   - Rate case support and prudency demonstration
   - Enhanced regulatory relationships

5. **Strategic & Capability Value:**
   - Direct enablement of enterprise strategic objectives
   - New organizational capabilities (platforms, skills, processes)
   - Competitive positioning or market differentiation
   - Option value for future strategic flexibility

### **Other Critical Criteria:**
✅ **ELT-Level Sponsorship** - C-suite or ELT sponsor fully committed, actively engaged
✅ **Strategic Alignment** - Board-level priority or mission-critical imperative
✅ **Future State Architecture** - Comprehensive architectural vision and migration roadmap
✅ **Multi-Year Plan** - Phased delivery with incremental value realization
✅ **Organizational Readiness** - Change management, capability building, workforce strategy
✅ **Risk Management** - Comprehensive risk framework with mitigation strategies

---

## Common Reasons for Gate 0 Rejection or Tabling

❌ **Insufficient Strategic Imperative** - Nice to have, but not mission-critical
❌ **Wrong Timing** - Organization not ready; competing priorities; market timing
❌ **Inadequate Sponsorship** - Sponsor not ELT-level or not fully committed
❌ **Feasibility Concerns** - High risk of failure; unproven technology; vendor viability
❌ **Value Not Transformational** - Incremental value, not transformational across all 5 categories
⏸ **Table for Future** - Right idea, but wait for strategic plan cycle, budget cycle, or org readiness

---

## After Authorization - Program Execution & Governance

**Tier 1 programs have ongoing executive governance:**

1. **Program Board Established** - Executive steering committee (quarterly meetings)
2. **Dedicated Program Office** - Program Director + full program team
3. **Quarterly Value Tracking** - Reported to TAC with variance analysis
4. **Annual Board Value Report** - Board presentation on program progress and value (if Board-approved)
5. **Architecture Governance** - EA team embedded in program for duration
6. **Multi-Year Execution** - Phased delivery over 3-5+ years

**Programs this significant have continuous executive visibility and governance.**

## What Makes a Successful Tier 1 Program Brief?

### **DO:**
✅ **Articulate strategic imperative clearly** - Why is this mission-critical NOW?
✅ **Secure ELT sponsor before submitting** - C-suite commitment is non-negotiable
✅ **Demonstrate transformational value** - Incremental value won't meet Tier 1 bar
✅ **Address all 5 value categories** - Financial ROI alone is insufficient
✅ **Be realistic about complexity and risk** - Acknowledge challenges, show mitigation
✅ **Engage Strategy Office early** - They are your partner, not a reviewer
✅ **Plan for multi-year journey** - Tier 1 is not a project, it's a program
✅ **Socialize broadly before submission** - Build coalition across organization

### **DON'T:**
❌ **Submit without Strategy Office partnership** - You'll be redirected to work with them first
❌ **Underestimate investment or timeline** - Overly optimistic plans lose credibility
❌ **Focus only on technology** - Organizational transformation is as important as tech
❌ **Skip organizational readiness assessment** - Change capacity is a real constraint
❌ **Assume Board approval is automatic** - Board has high standards and fiduciary duty
❌ **Go it alone** - Tier 1 requires cross-functional coalition and executive alignment

---

## Is Your Initiative Really Tier 1?

**Ask yourself:**
- Is this truly transformational, or is it a large project? (Large project = Tier 2)
- Does it affect the entire organization, or just multiple departments? (Multiple departments = Tier 2)
- Is it strategically mission-critical, or strategically beneficial? (Beneficial = Tier 2)
- Can it be accomplished in 12-18 months, or does it require 3-5 years? (<2 years = Tier 2)
- Does it introduce new strategic capabilities, or enhance existing ones? (Enhance = Tier 2)

**If you're unsure:** Contact Strategy Office for consultation. They'll help you determine correct tier and approach.
